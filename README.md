# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Overview
This weekâ€™s homework was to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. 

## Application Appearance
The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

### Highscores Page

## Application Functionality
When the user clicks the "Start" button the timer starts and they are presented with a series of questions. When a user answers a question wrong time is subtracted from the timer. When all the questions are answered or the timer reaches zero the user is prompted to enter the initials. When the user submits the score with their initials, the user is taken to a list of highscores.

## Functionality Status
The application runs as expected and captures the score correctly at the time the last question is answered with the exception that the timer continues to run.
